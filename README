-------------------
Status: 
  This no longer works ...
  I beliieve this is beause the api version has changed
  I have no plans to fix this as I don't use Discord anymore
-------------------
SHfire: Extremely basic Discord client using HTTP polling without a gateway
-------------------
# Setup:
  From Discord (Web/PC client):
  -----------------------------
  1. hit ctrl+shift+i
  2. switch to the network tab
  3. find discord API requests. This is usually called messages, ack, typing, etc...
  4. search for the authorization header. This is the token.
  5. once you have the token
  6. create the file ${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache/}/shfire/authkey
  7. with AUTHKEY= and then your token
    IE: AUTHKEY=XXXxXXXXXXX.xXXXXXXXX.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxXxX
  8. Run ./shfire for usage
